# Blog

Hello world! Welcome to my blog. This is a project I started based on a new years resolution to post something each week.

This repo is designed to work with [another project](https://github.com/sun-j/git-blogger) which I started to satisfy another resolution which is to learn front-end web development.

For now, this blog will contain interesting things that I learn on my journey to understanding the strange and wonderful world of web.
